# auto-pill-thesis-project
Code used in the development of an automatic pill dispenser for use with an MCA

These files were created by Carl Carey (201700613) for presentation in a thesis in partial fulfilment of the MEng Mechanical Engineering degree.
Project supervisor is Dr. Emma Henderson at the University of Strathclyde.

MATLAB code was created using MATLAB R2020b and the toolbox "app designer".
Testing has not been carried out any other release

The.xls file must accompany the code for proper appearance of the UITable elements within the app.
This file has preloaded example information included for testing.

Thank you.
